## Project Description

### Introduction:
This project was completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It focuses on data preprocessing tasks using Python and pandas library. The goal was to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Loading:** 
   - The project began with loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.

2. **Data Integrity Check:**
   - Initial data exploration was performed to identify inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and missing values in the dataset.

3. **Missing Data Handling:**
   - Missing values were addressed using appropriate strategies such as imputation or informed decision-making based on data characteristics.

4. **Duplicate Removal:**
   - Duplicate records were identified and eliminated to maintain data uniqueness and integrity.

5. **Standardization:**
   - Data formatting and units were standardized across the dataset to ensure consistency for accurate analysis.

6. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Outliers were detected using statistical methods like Z-score analysis to identify and address data points that could skew analysis or model performance.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy

### Conclusion:
This project provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing techniques, enhancing my skills in data manipulation and analysis. By ensuring data accuracy and reliability, it laid the foundation for further analysis and insights.
